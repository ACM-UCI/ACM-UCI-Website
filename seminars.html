                       fruitless results he plans to spend the next 20 years trying
                        to find a proof that P != NP.

                 <div class='popup hidden'>
                  <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                  What if you were able to prove a statement without ever revealing the proof.
                   In a sense you just convinced somebody of the validity of a statement by
                    having a conversation with them. They learn nothing more than that the
                     statement is true or false. What if you could prove a statement by just
                      randomly picking points and checking validity on those points. In this talk
                       I introduce Interactive Proof systems and talk about Zero Knowledge and PCP.
                        If none of this interests you here are a couple of  riddles that may:
                  Flip a coin over a telephone with a person you don’t trust. Can you construct
                   a protocol that guarantees a fair result that both parties agree on?
                  Or a protocol where you can play poker over the phone?
                  If any of these questions stump you, then this talk will answer it for you

                  Howard is a 4th-year Computer Science major and likely
                   the least-qualified of his peers to be graduating in June.
                    He does weird things for fun, and security things for fun and money.
                     His greatest achievement is successfully compiling a program with
                      zero errors on the first try.  Howard is 70% nerd, 30% president
                       of Cyber@UCI, 15% student, and 100% certain that's

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                    Talking about security oftentimes means involving
                     a bunch of fancy tools and technologies that you've
                      probably never heard of before. This talk has none
                       of that. We'll look at some of the easy yet not-so-obvious
                        ways anyone can "hack the system" to cause chaos and
                         destruction. You'll learn about some of the basic
                          concepts in physical security and social engineering,
                           and see how anyone can use those concepts for evil
                            (and how to protect yourself).

Within the talk, I will give a brief introduction to how the data is collected, a few success stories in this field such as companies like Arterys and Enlitic, and point to a few datasets and challenges so those interested can try it out.

                <div class='popup hidden'>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                    Functional programming is a programming paradigm
                     that is growing in popularity, but how often do
                      we deal with it in our classes? Sure, imperative
                       languages like Java, Python, and even C++ have
                        some built-in features to support functional
                         programming, but at the end of the day, these
                          languages still treat everything, even functions,
                           as objects. What if we could learn to think purely
                            in terms of functions? That’s exactly what purely
                             functional programming languages like Haskell
                              can help us do.

                  With the popularity and recent success of machine learning systems, they
                   are being used more and more for real life applications. This means that
                    issues and bugs with these system would have real world consequences, and
                     hence a lot of researchers are working on ways to make sure these systems
                      are safe, explainable, and easy to debug. This talk will touch upon few
                       examples, and perspective on this matter.
