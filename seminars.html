                  <strong>About Howard:</strong><br />
                  Howard is a 4th-year Computer Science major and likely
                   the least-qualified of his peers to be graduating in June.
                    He does weird things for fun, and security things for fun and money.
                     His greatest achievement is successfully compiling a program with
                      zero errors on the first try.  Howard is 70% nerd, 30% president
                       of Cyber@UCI, 15% student, and 100% certain that's
                        too many percentages

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                    Talking about security oftentimes means involving
                     a bunch of fancy tools and technologies that you've
                      probably never heard of before. This talk has none
                       of that. We'll look at some of the easy yet not-so-obvious
                        ways anyone can "hack the system" to cause chaos and
                         destruction. You'll learn about some of the basic
                          concepts in physical security and social engineering,
                           and see how anyone can use those concepts for evil
                            (and how to protect yourself).

                  Bryon Tjanaka is a first-year computer science major at UCI. As
                   a member of the ACM club, he has enjoyed learning to solve various
                    programming problems. Outside of academia, his chief interest is
                    ' robotics; in 2017, he won the VEX Robotics High School World Championship
                     as part of Team 86868. Other than that, he enjoys procrastinating by
                      folding origami, hitting the gym, and playing video games.

                <div class='popup hidden'>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
                    Functional programming is a programming paradigm
                     that is growing in popularity, but how often do
                      we deal with it in our classes? Sure, imperative
                       languages like Java, Python, and even C++ have
                        some built-in features to support functional
                         programming, but at the end of the day, these
                          languages still treat everything, even functions,
                           as objects. What if we could learn to think purely
                            in terms of functions? Thatâ€™s exactly what purely
                             functional programming languages like Haskell
                              can help us do.
