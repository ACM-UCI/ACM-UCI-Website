## Uploading Solution
You will need to be a current board member (hard coded XD) to submit solutions.

1. Log in in the Login tab using your uci.edu email.
2. Fill in the form and click submit:
    * Name          : problem name, please make it short and identifiable
    * Link          : full link to the problem, without additional queries (*see note_1*)
    * Difficulty    : select one from 'easy', 'med', 'hard', 'icpc' or 'codealong' (*see note_2!*)
    * Solution      : Upload file for solution (only accepts .py and .cpp) (*see note_1*)
    * Note          : optional note, place each point in a new line

* note_1: 
    If no link or no solution provided, will give photo and FB link
    of board member who contributed the problem. If no contributor
    assigned, then will give ACM logo and link to ACM page.
* note_2:
    Events and announcements can only be added by web dev team.

Why you can't submit:
- Name cannot be blank or more than 200 characters
- Link must start with a valid site (e.g. http://open.katis.com) [hard coded]
- Link must be unique (not submitted before)
- Must select a difficulty 
- Each board member can submit a maximum of 5 problems a week!

The Data tab will contain all submissions, including the problems that are used.
For now, only the web dev team and Karthik can set problems to sessions.
