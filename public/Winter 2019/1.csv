Note,Welcome to ACM for Winter 2019. Since you all are foolish enough to open this document I may as well give a shout out to out seminar series (Free Pizza) on Thursdays from 5-6 on some weeks more updates on Facebook page. You get to listen to interesting talks. Also if you guys are doing problems for interviews and need help with any of the problems donâ€™t feel shy asking any of the board members. They should all be able to help. Promise that problems will get more interesting as quarter progresses.,announcement,,1,Karthik
